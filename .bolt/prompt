- Identify bugs or unused files.
- Suggest best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Code Standards

- Accessibility-friendly (semantic HTML, alt text, ARIA labels if needed).
- Clean, well-commented code.

## Preferred Output Style

- Provide small, actionable steps rather than overwhelming changes.
